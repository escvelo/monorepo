# MotionPlanning

## Part 5: The first motion planning algorithm

Assuming the vacuum robot runs out of battery it has to navigate to its charging station.
1) Program a sPRM that will guide the robot to its goal.
1) Use uniform sampling of the configuration space.
2) For finding nearest neighbours use brute force.
3) For the metric use the Euclidean metric.
4) For finding the shortest path use a Djkstra (Use a lib, do not program it on your own)
2) Make sure you can edit the parameters of the algorithm in the UI.
3) Make sure you can run multiple tries of the algorithm.
Note: Use a challenging start and goal point.
4) Test your algorithm and give an approximate number of samples that are needed to solve the problem in 
90% of the tests.
Note: For this you have to run the algorithm multiple times (at least 10 times) with the same parameters and measure the success.
Optional:
Go online and find some Rooms and robots on your own and test your software with them.

## Part 7: Implement a paper
Implement one of the following papers or search for a paper that you 
want to implement. For the second, please check with me first before 
you start to implement (Some papers are complex).
The order of the following papers are with increasing complexity. 
(simple -> medium)
